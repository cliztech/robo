## 2026-05-25 - [DoS via Malformed Cron Config]
**Vulnerability:** Malformed cron strings (e.g., missing fields or invalid tokens) in `schedules.json` caused unhandled `ValueError` in `SchedulerUiService._build_timeline_blocks`, crashing the entire UI state endpoint (DoS).
**Learning:** Pydantic validation on input models (`ScheduleRecord`) is insufficient if internal logic (like `_cron_day_to_name`) performs stricter validation that raises unhandled exceptions. Input validation must be layered: initial structural validation + robust runtime handling for complex parsing logic.
**Prevention:** Wrap complex parsing logic (especially for string formats like cron) in try-except blocks to fail gracefully (log and skip) rather than crashing the service.

## 2026-07-23 - [Subshell exec mitigation]
**Vulnerability:** Unsanitized user input passed to bash -lc inside spawn() can lead to arbitrary code execution (Command Injection).
**Learning:** Using string interpolation with user input in shell subshells is unsafe.
**Prevention:** Always use spawn with an executable string and an array of arguments directly, avoiding shell invocation and string-based commands.

## 2026-07-24 - [Log redaction for CLI args]
**Vulnerability:** Passing a credentials URI (e.g. `icecast://user:pass@host`) as a command-line argument (to `ffmpeg`) exposed the password in plaintext when the application logged the entire arguments array.
**Learning:** Application logs that dump internal process configurations or spawned command arguments are common sources of credential leaks if the arguments include authenticated URIs.
**Prevention:** Sanitize or selectively redact command line arguments that contain credential URIs (such as those starting with `icecast://` or `redis://`) before emitting them to the logging system.

## 2026-07-25 - [Router Level Auth Missing]
**Vulnerability:** Shared dependencies like `verify_api_key` were enforced on individual route function signatures instead of at the APIRouter level. This design can lead to missing authorization checks when new endpoints are added, as developers might forget to include the dependency.
**Learning:** In FastAPI, secure endpoints must be protected by authentication/authorization dependencies. Enforcing these dependencies at the APIRouter level prevents accidental omissions on new endpoints, ensuring consistent security coverage.
**Prevention:** Apply shared dependencies like `dependencies=[Depends(verify_api_key)]` at the APIRouter level instead of on individual routes to ensure comprehensive and fail-safe authorization enforcement.
