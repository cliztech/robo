## 2026-05-25 - [DoS via Malformed Cron Config]
**Vulnerability:** Malformed cron strings (e.g., missing fields or invalid tokens) in `schedules.json` caused unhandled `ValueError` in `SchedulerUiService._build_timeline_blocks`, crashing the entire UI state endpoint (DoS).
**Learning:** Pydantic validation on input models (`ScheduleRecord`) is insufficient if internal logic (like `_cron_day_to_name`) performs stricter validation that raises unhandled exceptions. Input validation must be layered: initial structural validation + robust runtime handling for complex parsing logic.
**Prevention:** Wrap complex parsing logic (especially for string formats like cron) in try-except blocks to fail gracefully (log and skip) rather than crashing the service.

## 2026-07-23 - [Subshell exec mitigation]
**Vulnerability:** Unsanitized user input passed to bash -lc inside spawn() can lead to arbitrary code execution (Command Injection).
**Learning:** Using string interpolation with user input in shell subshells is unsafe.
**Prevention:** Always use spawn with an executable string and an array of arguments directly, avoiding shell invocation and string-based commands.

## 2026-07-24 - [Log redaction for CLI args]
**Vulnerability:** Passing a credentials URI (e.g. `icecast://user:pass@host`) as a command-line argument (to `ffmpeg`) exposed the password in plaintext when the application logged the entire arguments array.
**Learning:** Application logs that dump internal process configurations or spawned command arguments are common sources of credential leaks if the arguments include authenticated URIs.
**Prevention:** Sanitize or selectively redact command line arguments that contain credential URIs (such as those starting with `icecast://` or `redis://`) before emitting them to the logging system.

## 2026-08-28 - [Secure by Default Router Authentication]
**Vulnerability:** Fast API routes relied on individual endpoints explicitly declaring `_: str = Depends(verify_api_key)` for authentication.
**Learning:** Depending on individual route definitions for authentication creates a risk of accidental omission on new endpoints, leading to unauthenticated access. Enforcing authentication at the `APIRouter` level using `dependencies=[Depends(verify_api_key)]` implements a "Secure by Default" posture where all routes inherit the protection automatically.
**Prevention:** Apply authentication dependencies at the router level for any API that exclusively requires secured endpoints.
