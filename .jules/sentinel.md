## 2026-05-25 - [DoS via Malformed Cron Config]
**Vulnerability:** Malformed cron strings (e.g., missing fields or invalid tokens) in `schedules.json` caused unhandled `ValueError` in `SchedulerUiService._build_timeline_blocks`, crashing the entire UI state endpoint (DoS).
**Learning:** Pydantic validation on input models (`ScheduleRecord`) is insufficient if internal logic (like `_cron_day_to_name`) performs stricter validation that raises unhandled exceptions. Input validation must be layered: initial structural validation + robust runtime handling for complex parsing logic.
**Prevention:** Wrap complex parsing logic (especially for string formats like cron) in try-except blocks to fail gracefully (log and skip) rather than crashing the service.

## 2026-07-23 - [Subshell exec mitigation]
**Vulnerability:** Unsanitized user input passed to bash -lc inside spawn() can lead to arbitrary code execution (Command Injection).
**Learning:** Using string interpolation with user input in shell subshells is unsafe.
**Prevention:** Always use spawn with an executable string and an array of arguments directly, avoiding shell invocation and string-based commands.

## 2026-07-24 - [Log redaction for CLI args]
**Vulnerability:** Passing a credentials URI (e.g. `icecast://user:pass@host`) as a command-line argument (to `ffmpeg`) exposed the password in plaintext when the application logged the entire arguments array.
**Learning:** Application logs that dump internal process configurations or spawned command arguments are common sources of credential leaks if the arguments include authenticated URIs.
**Prevention:** Sanitize or selectively redact command line arguments that contain credential URIs (such as those starting with `icecast://` or `redis://`) before emitting them to the logging system.

## 2026-08-01 - [FastAPI API Key Auth Omission Risk]
**Vulnerability:** In FastAPI, relying on `Depends(verify_api_key)` within individual route function signatures risks accidental exposure if new routes are added and the dependency is forgotten.
**Learning:** Security controls like authentication should be enforced at the boundary level (e.g., `APIRouter(dependencies=[Depends(verify_api_key)])`) rather than relying on developers to remember to add them to every individual route.
**Prevention:** Enforce shared dependencies at the `APIRouter` level. It is safe to retain the identical `Depends` declaration in specific individual route signatures that require the return value (e.g., `api_key: str = Depends(verify_api_key)`), as FastAPI caches dependency results by default (`use_cache=True`).
