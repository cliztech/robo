## 2026-05-25 - [DoS via Malformed Cron Config]
**Vulnerability:** Malformed cron strings (e.g., missing fields or invalid tokens) in `schedules.json` caused unhandled `ValueError` in `SchedulerUiService._build_timeline_blocks`, crashing the entire UI state endpoint (DoS).
**Learning:** Pydantic validation on input models (`ScheduleRecord`) is insufficient if internal logic (like `_cron_day_to_name`) performs stricter validation that raises unhandled exceptions. Input validation must be layered: initial structural validation + robust runtime handling for complex parsing logic.
**Prevention:** Wrap complex parsing logic (especially for string formats like cron) in try-except blocks to fail gracefully (log and skip) rather than crashing the service.

## 2026-07-23 - [Subshell exec mitigation]
**Vulnerability:** Unsanitized user input passed to bash -lc inside spawn() can lead to arbitrary code execution (Command Injection).
**Learning:** Using string interpolation with user input in shell subshells is unsafe.
**Prevention:** Always use spawn with an executable string and an array of arguments directly, avoiding shell invocation and string-based commands.

## 2026-07-24 - [Log redaction for CLI args]
**Vulnerability:** Passing a credentials URI (e.g. `icecast://user:pass@host`) as a command-line argument (to `ffmpeg`) exposed the password in plaintext when the application logged the entire arguments array.
**Learning:** Application logs that dump internal process configurations or spawned command arguments are common sources of credential leaks if the arguments include authenticated URIs.
**Prevention:** Sanitize or selectively redact command line arguments that contain credential URIs (such as those starting with `icecast://` or `redis://`) before emitting them to the logging system.

## 2024-05-24 - [Fix Bandit B608 False Positive in SQLite Status Alert Repository]
**Vulnerability:** Bandit SAST flags `f""` strings inside `connection.execute` as B608 (hardcoded_sql_expressions) even when properly parameterized.
**Learning:** This is a false positive when dynamically generating `IN` clauses with placeholders.
**Prevention:** Use `.replace("%s", placeholders)` to format the query string and append a `# nosec B608` comment to the execution line.
