## Agent delivery contract

Agents are expected to continuously produce and maintain the following artifact types:

- Product code and tests
- CI configuration and release tooling
- Internal developer tools
- Documentation and design history
- Evaluation harnesses
- Review comments and responses
- Scripts that manage the repository itself
