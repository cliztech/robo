# Online Radio DJ - System Design Document

## 1. Executive Summary
The **Online Radio DJ** is an autonomous, AI-driven internet radio station platform. It replaces legacy desktop automation tools (like RoboDJ) with a modern, web-based, cloud-native architecture. It integrates seamlessly with the "AI Music Agents" ecosystem to broadcast AI-generated music alongside human-curated tracks, hosted by dynamic AI personalities.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### A. Core Components
1.  **Frontend (Next.js)**:
    -   **Dashboard**: Manage schedules, playlists, and AI host personalities.
    -   **Studio View**: Real-time visualizer of the broadcast queue and audio levels.
    -   **Public Player**: Embeddable web player for listeners.
2.  **Backend (Python FastAPI)**:
    -   **Scheduler Engine**: Determines what plays next (Music vs. Talk).
    -   **Content Manager**: CRUD for Tracks, Prompts, and Ad/Promo spots.
    -   **Agent Orchestrator**: Manages the "DJ Agent" lifecycle.
3.  **Audio Pipeline (Python/FFmpeg/Liquidsoap)**:
    -   **Streamer**: Generates the continuous audio stream (Icecast/HLS).
    -   **Mixer**: Handles crossfades, ducking (lowering music volume during speech), and FX.
    -   **Synthesizer**: Interfacing with TTS providers (ElevenLabs, OpenAI).

### B. Integration with AI Music Agents
-   **Source Material**: Automatically ingests tracks generated by the `Composer` and `Producer` agents.
-   **Metadata**: Reads rich metadata (Mood, BPM, Key, Genre) to inform DJ scripts and transitions.
-   **Live Interaction**: The DJ Agent can "interview" the Musician Agents about their new tracks.

## 3. Detailed Modules

### 3.1. The DJ Agent ("Host")
*A specialized agent responsible for the "Voice" of the station.*

-   **Persona Profile**:
    -   `Name`, `Backstory`, `VoiceID`, `Tone` (e.g., "Hype", "Chill", "NPR-style").
    -   `Knowledge Base`: Access to artist bios, song facts, weather, and news.
-   **Scripting Engine (LLM)**:
    -   Generates "Links" (speech between songs).
    -   **Input**: Previous Song, Next Song, Station ID, Current Time, Weather, Listener Requests.
    -   **Output**: Natural language script with SSML tags for emotional inflection.

### 3.2. Scheduler & Playlist Manager
*The "Brain" that decides the programming.*

-   **Clock Wheels**: Define templates for an hour (e.g., "Top of Hour ID" -> "Power Hit" -> "DJ Link" -> "New Release").
-   **Rules Engine**:
    -   *Artist Separation*: "Don't play the same artist within 60 minutes."
    -   *Tempo Flow*: "Gradually increase BPM from 6 PM to 9 PM."

### 3.3. Streaming Server
*The "Mouth" that broadcasts to the world.*

-   **Protocol**: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) for low-latency web playback, or Icecast for compatibility.
-   **Transcoding**: Real-time encoding to AAC/MP3.
-   **Metadata Push**: Updates "Now Playing" info on the frontend.

## 4. Data Model (Draft Schema)

### Tracks
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "Neon Nights",
  "artist": "AI Synthwave Collective",
  "duration": 245,
  "intro_duration": 12,
  "outro_duration": 15,
  "file_path": "s3://...",
  "bpm": 128,
  "energy": 0.8,
  "codec": "aac | mp3 | flac | wav",
  "sample_rate_hz": 44100,
  "bitrate_kbps": 320,
  "channels": 2,
  "integrated_lufs": -13.7,
  "true_peak_dbtp": -1.0,
  "is_explicit": false,
  "content_rating": "clean | explicit | radio_edit",
  "isrc": "USRC17607839",
  "label": "Night Drive Records",
  "release_date": "2026-01-20",
  "artwork_url": "https://cdn.example.com/artwork/track-id.jpg",
  "waveform_url": "https://cdn.example.com/waveforms/track-id.json",
  "rights_status": "cleared | pending | blocked",
  "availability_status": "ready | geo_blocked | hold | takedown",
  "ingestion_status": "ingested | normalized | qa_failed | schedulable"
}
```

### Track Metadata Constraints for `schedulable`

A track may move to `ingestion_status = schedulable` only when all of the following are true:

- **Core metadata present**: `id`, `title`, `artist`, `duration`, `file_path`.
- **Ingestion metadata present**: `codec`, `sample_rate_hz`, `bitrate_kbps`, `channels`.
- **QA loudness metadata present**: `integrated_lufs`, `true_peak_dbtp`.
- **Compliance metadata present**: `is_explicit`, `content_rating`, `rights_status`, `availability_status`.
- **Catalog metadata present**: `release_date`.
- **Rights/availability gate**:
  - `rights_status = cleared`
  - `availability_status = ready`
- **Audio QA gate** (configurable policy defaults):
  - `integrated_lufs` between `-16` and `-12`
  - `true_peak_dbtp <= -1.0`

Optional-but-recommended metadata for discovery/player UX: `isrc`, `label`, `artwork_url`, `waveform_url`.

### Frontend Exposure (Admin + Player)

- **Admin track tables** should display:
  - `ingestion_status` (with badges)
  - `rights_status`
  - `availability_status`
  - `content_rating`
  - QA summary (`integrated_lufs`, `true_peak_dbtp`)
- **Admin filters** should include:
  - `ingestion_status` (especially `schedulable` vs non-schedulable)
  - `rights_status`
  - `availability_status`
  - `is_explicit` / `content_rating`
  - QA out-of-range toggle
- **Player-facing tables/cards** should expose:
  - `artwork_url` for cover display
  - `waveform_url` for waveform rendering
  - explicit badge based on `is_explicit` / `content_rating`

### BroadcastQueue
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "scheduled_time": "2023-10-27T14:00:00Z",
  "item_type": "track | voice_link | jingle",
  "item_id": "uuid",
  "status": "pending | playing | played"
}
```

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Engine (MVP)
-   [ ] Python script to generate a single "Show" (MP3 file) from a list of songs.
-   [ ] Basic LLM integration to announce song titles.
-   [ ] Simple crossfade mixing.

### Phase 2: Streaming & Scheduling
-   [ ] Implement Shoutcast/Icecast server connection.
-   [ ] Build the "Clock Wheel" scheduler logic.
-   [ ] Real-time weather/time injection.

### Phase 3: Web Integration
-   [ ] Admin Dashboard for uploading tracks and configuring DJ.
-   [ ] Public Player with "Now Playing" data.

## 6. Technology Stack Recommendations
-   **Language**: Python 3.11+ (Backend), TypeScript (Frontend).
-   **Audio Processing**: `pydub` (simple) or `ffmpeg-python` (complex).
-   **Streaming**: `Liquidsoap` (industry standard for radio automation) or custom FFmpeg stream.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (robustness) or SQLite (simplicity).
-   **AI**: LangChain (orchestration), OpenAI/Anthropic (LLM), ElevenLabs (TTS).
