# Online Radio DJ - System Design Document

## 1. Executive Summary
The **Online Radio DJ** is an autonomous, AI-driven internet radio station platform. It replaces legacy desktop automation tools (like RoboDJ) with a modern, web-based, cloud-native architecture. It integrates seamlessly with the "AI Music Agents" ecosystem to broadcast AI-generated music alongside human-curated tracks, hosted by dynamic AI personalities.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### A. Core Components
1.  **Frontend (Next.js)**:
    -   **Dashboard**: Manage schedules, playlists, and AI host personalities.
    -   **Studio View**: Real-time visualizer of the broadcast queue and audio levels.
    -   **Public Player**: Embeddable web player for listeners.
2.  **Backend (Python FastAPI)**:
    -   **Scheduler Engine**: Determines what plays next (Music vs. Talk).
    -   **Content Manager**: CRUD for Tracks, Prompts, and Ad/Promo spots.
    -   **Agent Orchestrator**: Manages the "DJ Agent" lifecycle.
3.  **Audio Pipeline (Python/FFmpeg/Liquidsoap)**:
    -   **Streamer**: Generates the continuous audio stream (Icecast/HLS).
    -   **Mixer**: Handles crossfades, ducking (lowering music volume during speech), and FX.
    -   **Synthesizer**: Interfacing with TTS providers (ElevenLabs, OpenAI).

### B. Integration with AI Music Agents
-   **Source Material**: Automatically ingests tracks generated by the `Composer` and `Producer` agents.
-   **Metadata**: Reads rich metadata (Mood, BPM, Key, Genre) to inform DJ scripts and transitions.
-   **Live Interaction**: The DJ Agent can "interview" the Musician Agents about their new tracks.

## 3. Detailed Modules

### 3.1. The DJ Agent ("Host")
*A specialized agent responsible for the "Voice" of the station.*

-   **Persona Profile**:
    -   `Name`, `Backstory`, `VoiceID`, `Tone` (e.g., "Hype", "Chill", "NPR-style").
    -   `Knowledge Base`: Access to artist bios, song facts, weather, and news.
-   **Scripting Engine (LLM)**:
    -   Generates "Links" (speech between songs).
    -   **Input**: Previous Song, Next Song, Station ID, Current Time, Weather, Listener Requests.
    -   **Output**: Natural language script with SSML tags for emotional inflection.

### 3.2. Scheduler & Playlist Manager
*The "Brain" that decides the programming.*

-   **Clock Wheels**: Define templates for an hour (e.g., "Top of Hour ID" -> "Power Hit" -> "DJ Link" -> "New Release").
-   **Rules Engine**:
    -   *Artist Separation*: "Don't play the same artist within 60 minutes."
    -   *Tempo Flow*: "Gradually increase BPM from 6 PM to 9 PM."

### 3.3. Streaming Server
*The "Mouth" that broadcasts to the world.*

-   **Protocol**: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) for low-latency web playback, or Icecast for compatibility.
-   **Transcoding**: Real-time encoding to AAC/MP3.
-   **Metadata Push**: Updates "Now Playing" info on the frontend.

## 4. Data Model (Draft Schema)

### Tracks
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "Neon Nights",
  "artist": "AI Synthwave Collective",
  "duration": 245,
  "intro_duration": 12,
  "outro_duration": 15,
  "file_path": "s3://...",
  "bpm": 128,
  "energy": 0.8
}
```

### BroadcastQueue
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "scheduled_time": "2023-10-27T14:00:00Z",
  "item_type": "track | voice_link | jingle | ad_spot | station_id",
  "item_ref": {
    "track": { "track_id": "uuid" },
    "voice_link": { "voice_link_id": "uuid" },
    "jingle": { "jingle_id": "uuid" },
    "ad_spot": { "ad_spot_id": "uuid" },
    "station_id": { "station_id_id": "uuid" }
  },
  "resolved_title": "Neon Nights",
  "resolved_duration": 245,
  "origin": "scheduler | manual | auto",
  "status": "pending | playing | played"
}
```

#### Typed Queue Reference Model (replace legacy `item_id`)
- `item_type` is the discriminator enum for the queue row and determines the expected shape of `item_ref`.
- `item_ref` is a typed object that stores the entity-specific foreign key. The backend should validate that only one branch is populated and that it matches `item_type`.
- `resolved_title` and `resolved_duration` are denormalized snapshots captured when a row is queued or refreshed. They are used for stable rendering even if the linked entity changes later.
- `origin` records how the row entered the queue:
  - `scheduler`: inserted by the clock wheel/rules engine.
  - `manual`: inserted by an operator in Studio/Dashboard.
  - `auto`: inserted by runtime automation (e.g., fallback fill, emergency ID, auto-DJ).

#### Frontend Resolution Rules by `item_type`
- `track`:
  - Resolve `item_ref.track.track_id` against the Tracks API/detail cache.
  - Primary view: full track card (title, artist, artwork, duration, metadata).
- `voice_link`:
  - Resolve `item_ref.voice_link.voice_link_id` against generated script/TTS assets.
  - Primary view: script preview + selected voice/persona + estimated duration.
- `jingle`:
  - Resolve `item_ref.jingle.jingle_id` against station imaging library.
  - Primary view: jingle name, category (TOH, sweep, branding), duration.
- `ad_spot`:
  - Resolve `item_ref.ad_spot.ad_spot_id` against ad inventory/campaign service.
  - Primary view: advertiser, campaign/flight, compliance tags, duration.
- `station_id`:
  - Resolve `item_ref.station_id.station_id_id` against station ID registry.
  - Primary view: ID variant/voice, legal ID marker, duration.

#### Missing/Deleted Linked Entity Behavior
- Queue rows are immutable for playout; missing linked entities must **not** remove or renumber existing rows.
- If live lookup fails (deleted, permission denied, stale cache, or API timeout):
  1. Render row using `resolved_title` and `resolved_duration`.
  2. Show degraded-state badge (`Missing source`) and disable deep-link navigation for that row.
  3. Keep playout policy configurable:
     - Default: skip item at playout and log `queue_item_unresolvable` event.
     - Optional fallback mode: play a configured emergency asset (e.g., station ID bed) and continue.
- Backend should emit a reconciliation event so operators can repair queue references without losing playout history.

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Engine (MVP)
-   [ ] Python script to generate a single "Show" (MP3 file) from a list of songs.
-   [ ] Basic LLM integration to announce song titles.
-   [ ] Simple crossfade mixing.

### Phase 2: Streaming & Scheduling
-   [ ] Implement Shoutcast/Icecast server connection.
-   [ ] Build the "Clock Wheel" scheduler logic.
-   [ ] Real-time weather/time injection.

### Phase 3: Web Integration
-   [ ] Admin Dashboard for uploading tracks and configuring DJ.
-   [ ] Public Player with "Now Playing" data.

## 6. Technology Stack Recommendations
-   **Language**: Python 3.11+ (Backend), TypeScript (Frontend).
-   **Audio Processing**: `pydub` (simple) or `ffmpeg-python` (complex).
-   **Streaming**: `Liquidsoap` (industry standard for radio automation) or custom FFmpeg stream.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (robustness) or SQLite (simplicity).
-   **AI**: LangChain (orchestration), OpenAI/Anthropic (LLM), ElevenLabs (TTS).
