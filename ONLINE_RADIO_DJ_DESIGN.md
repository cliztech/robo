# Online Radio DJ - System Design Document

## 1. Executive Summary
The **Online Radio DJ** is an autonomous, AI-driven internet radio station platform. It replaces legacy desktop automation tools (like RoboDJ) with a modern, web-based, cloud-native architecture. It integrates seamlessly with the "AI Music Agents" ecosystem to broadcast AI-generated music alongside human-curated tracks, hosted by dynamic AI personalities.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### A. Core Components
1.  **Frontend (Next.js)**:
    -   **Dashboard**: Manage schedules, playlists, and AI host personalities.
    -   **Studio View**: Real-time visualizer of the broadcast queue and audio levels.
    -   **Public Player**: Embeddable web player for listeners.
2.  **Backend (Python FastAPI)**:
    -   **Scheduler Engine**: Determines what plays next (Music vs. Talk).
    -   **Content Manager**: CRUD for Tracks, Prompts, and Ad/Promo spots.
    -   **Agent Orchestrator**: Manages the "DJ Agent" lifecycle.
3.  **Audio Pipeline (Python/FFmpeg/Liquidsoap)**:
    -   **Streamer**: Generates the continuous audio stream (Icecast/HLS).
    -   **Mixer**: Handles crossfades, ducking (lowering music volume during speech), and FX.
    -   **Synthesizer**: Interfacing with TTS providers (ElevenLabs, OpenAI).

### B. Integration with AI Music Agents
-   **Source Material**: Automatically ingests tracks generated by the `Composer` and `Producer` agents.
-   **Metadata**: Reads rich metadata (Mood, BPM, Key, Genre) to inform DJ scripts and transitions.
-   **Live Interaction**: The DJ Agent can "interview" the Musician Agents about their new tracks.

## 3. Detailed Modules

### 3.1. The DJ Agent ("Host")
*A specialized agent responsible for the "Voice" of the station.*

-   **Persona Profile**:
    -   `Name`, `Backstory`, `VoiceID`, `Tone` (e.g., "Hype", "Chill", "NPR-style").
    -   `Knowledge Base`: Access to artist bios, song facts, weather, and news.
-   **Scripting Engine (LLM)**:
    -   Generates "Links" (speech between songs).
    -   **Input**: Previous Song, Next Song, Station ID, Current Time, Weather, Listener Requests.
    -   **Output**: Natural language script with SSML tags for emotional inflection.

### 3.2. Scheduler & Playlist Manager
*The "Brain" that decides the programming.*

-   **Clock Wheels**: Define templates for an hour (e.g., "Top of Hour ID" -> "Power Hit" -> "DJ Link" -> "New Release").
-   **Rules Engine**:
    -   *Artist Separation*: "Don't play the same artist within 60 minutes."
    -   *Tempo Flow*: "Gradually increase BPM from 6 PM to 9 PM."

### 3.3. Streaming Server
*The "Mouth" that broadcasts to the world.*

-   **Protocol**: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) for low-latency web playback, or Icecast for compatibility.
-   **Transcoding**: Real-time encoding to AAC/MP3.
-   **Metadata Push**: Updates "Now Playing" info on the frontend.

## 4. Data Model (Draft Schema)

### Tracks
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "Neon Nights",
  "artist": "AI Synthwave Collective",
  "duration": 245,
  "intro_duration": 12,
  "outro_duration": 15,
  "file_path": "s3://...",
  "bpm": 128,
  "energy": 0.8
}
```

### BroadcastQueue
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "scheduled_time": "2023-10-27T14:00:00Z",
  "item_type": "track | voice_link | jingle",
  "item_id": "uuid",
  "status": "pending | ready | starting | playing | completed | failed | retry_scheduled | skipped | cancelled",
  "error_code": "optional_machine_readable_code",
  "error_message": "optional_human_readable_message",
  "retry_count": 0,
  "last_attempt_at": "2023-10-27T13:59:58Z",
  "created_at": "2023-10-27T13:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-10-27T14:00:05Z",
  "started_at": "2023-10-27T14:00:00Z",
  "finished_at": "2023-10-27T14:03:40Z"
}
```

#### `broadcast_queue_item` field notes
- `status` is a full lifecycle enum and must always be present.
- `error_code`, `error_message`, `retry_count`, and `last_attempt_at` are structured error metadata:
  - `error_code`: stable backend string for programmatic handling (for example, `tts_timeout`, `asset_missing`, `stream_unavailable`).
  - `error_message`: human-readable diagnostic text for operators.
  - `retry_count`: non-negative integer incremented on each execution attempt.
  - `last_attempt_at`: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp for the latest attempt.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, `started_at`, `finished_at` are optional audit timestamps and must use ISO 8601 UTC format when present (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`).

#### Lifecycle transition rules (deterministic)
Allowed status transitions for `broadcast_queue_item`:

- `pending -> ready | cancelled`
- `ready -> starting | skipped | cancelled`
- `starting -> playing | failed`
- `playing -> completed | failed`
- `failed -> retry_scheduled | cancelled`
- `retry_scheduled -> ready | cancelled`

Terminal states (no further transitions):
- `completed`
- `skipped`
- `cancelled`

Validation rules:
- `started_at` is set when entering `starting` (or backfilled when directly entering `playing`).
- `finished_at` is set when entering terminal states (`completed`, `skipped`, `cancelled`) and SHOULD be set for unrecoverable `failed` items.
- `error_code` and `error_message` SHOULD be set whenever `status = failed`.
- `retry_count` MUST increase monotonically across `retry_scheduled -> ready -> starting` cycles.

#### Backend-to-UI status category mapping
Expose the following stable mapping so frontend badges and available actions are deterministic:

| Backend status | UI category | Suggested badge/action behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pending`, `ready`, `starting`, `playing`, `completed` | `ok` | Normal flow (show queue/progress controls). |
| `retry_scheduled`, `skipped` | `warn` | Attention needed but non-fatal (show retry/reschedule context). |
| `failed`, `cancelled` | `error` | Error/blocked state (show details from `error_code`/`error_message`). |

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Engine (MVP)
-   [ ] Python script to generate a single "Show" (MP3 file) from a list of songs.
-   [ ] Basic LLM integration to announce song titles.
-   [ ] Simple crossfade mixing.

### Phase 2: Streaming & Scheduling
-   [ ] Implement Shoutcast/Icecast server connection.
-   [ ] Build the "Clock Wheel" scheduler logic.
-   [ ] Real-time weather/time injection.

### Phase 3: Web Integration
-   [ ] Admin Dashboard for uploading tracks and configuring DJ.
-   [ ] Public Player with "Now Playing" data.

## 6. Technology Stack Recommendations
-   **Language**: Python 3.11+ (Backend), TypeScript (Frontend).
-   **Audio Processing**: `pydub` (simple) or `ffmpeg-python` (complex).
-   **Streaming**: `Liquidsoap` (industry standard for radio automation) or custom FFmpeg stream.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (robustness) or SQLite (simplicity).
-   **AI**: LangChain (orchestration), OpenAI/Anthropic (LLM), ElevenLabs (TTS).
