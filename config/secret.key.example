# RoboDJ Secret Key Template (example only)
#
# This file is a template/example committed to git for format guidance only.
# Do not commit real key material.
#
# Production storage locations (outside git history):
#   - config/secret.key (local runtime file, git-ignored)
#   - config/secret_v2.key (local runtime file, git-ignored)
# Preferred source-of-truth:
#   - Secret manager/vault with deployment-time injection.
#
# Operator checks before activation:
# - Verify provenance (approved vault flow or approved local generation command).
# - Verify value has not appeared in repository history, docs, tickets, or chat logs.
#
# Example generation (32 random bytes, base64):
#   python - <<'PY'
#   import secrets, base64
#   print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(secrets.token_bytes(32)).decode())
#   PY
#
# Replace this placeholder only in `config/secret.key`, not in this template.
