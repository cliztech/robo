# Phase-4 Sprint Plan Baseline

## Scope lock (approved backlog only)
- Scope source is **only** `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/gui-console-epics-stories.md` (42 approved stories across E1-E7).
- No unscoped additions are allowed during execution; new requests must follow change-control.
- Sprint slicing reference from source: **E6 stories 2-6 + E7 stories 1-6 + defect burn-down.**.

## Hard quality gates
- Plan completeness: **100% required** (scope, constraints, rollback, verification on every story).
- Evidence completeness: **100% required** (acceptance criteria + validation commands + predecessor + rollback captured per story).
- Verification command list is attached to every story before it can enter `ready-for-dev`.

## Change-control path (scope freeze)
1. **Defer**: move request to post-sprint backlog if it does not block committed stories.
2. **Split**: carve only the blocking subset into a narrowly scoped story and keep remainder deferred.
3. **Re-plan**: if request invalidates critical assumptions, run `bmad-bmm-correct-course`, then regenerate sprint plan/status.
