# TI-002 — Add role-aware settings visibility model (`admin`, `operator`, `viewer`)

- **Status:** Closed
- **Owner role:** Security Engineer
- **Effort:** M
- **Dependencies:** Current settings surface inventory; role model definitions
- **Implementation artifact:** `docs/exec-plans/active/ti-002-role-aware-settings-visibility-model.md`

## Definition of done

- Access matrix documents which settings are visible/editable for each role.
- Enforcement points are identified in runtime/config interfaces.
- Test cases exist for allow/deny outcomes per role.

## Completion notes

- Added a role-by-surface access matrix covering admin/operator/viewer permissions.
- Defined backend + frontend enforcement points with deterministic deny semantics.
- Added explicit allow/deny validation cases (`RV-01` through `RV-10`) for test implementation.
