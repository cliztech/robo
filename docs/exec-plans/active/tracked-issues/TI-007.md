# TI-007 — v1.2 UI: drag/drop weekly timeline on normalized schedule contracts

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner role:** UI Engineer
- **Effort:** L
- **Dependencies:** `docs/schedule_schema.md`; backend `/api/v1/scheduler-ui/state` and `/validate` normalized contracts

## Definition of done

- Week timeline renders from normalized `timeline_blocks` without UI-side shape translation.
- Drag/drop + resize support 15-minute snap and 5-minute modifier behavior.
- Interaction updates call `/validate` and preserve normalized request/response payloads.
- Acceptance checks for interaction latency (`<=200 ms p95`) are captured in execution evidence.
