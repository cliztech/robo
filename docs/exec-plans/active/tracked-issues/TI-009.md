# TI-009 — v1.2 UI: keyboard parity for timeline edit and conflict resolution

- **Status:** Closed
- **Owner role:** Accessibility Engineer
- **Effort:** M
- **Dependencies:** TI-007; TI-008; normalized block + conflict action contracts
- **Implementation artifact:** `docs/exec-plans/active/ti-009b-timeline-keyboard-parity.md`

## Definition of done

- Keyboard operations (move/resize/resolve) use the same normalized block/conflict actions as pointer interactions.
- Focus order and visual focus indicators remain correct across timeline blocks and conflict controls.
- Destructive keyboard actions follow confirmation + undo/redo safeguards.
- Keyboard-only path satisfies v1.2 conflict-resolution and error-prevention acceptance checks.
