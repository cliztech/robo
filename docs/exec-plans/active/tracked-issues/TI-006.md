# TI-006 — Add a pre-release security gate in release documentation

- **Status:** Closed
- **Owner role:** Release Manager
- **Effort:** S
- **Dependencies:** Outputs from `TI-004` and `TI-005`; release checklist document

## Definition of done

- Release documentation includes a mandatory security gate section.
- Gate requires sign-off for key-rotation readiness and redaction contract test results.
- Failing any required security check blocks release readiness.

## Closure evidence

- `PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` includes a dedicated `Track A pre-release security gate (A3.2)` section with explicit PASS/FAIL criteria and required signer table.
- Verification command: `rg -n "Track A pre-release security gate \(A3.2\)|PASS/FAIL|sign-off" PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`
- Closed via story packet: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/todo-06-pre-release-security-gate-docs.md`
