# TI-008 — v1.2 UI: inline conflict rendering and resolution actions

- **Status:** Open
- **Owner role:** UI Engineer
- **Effort:** M
- **Dependencies:** TI-007; deterministic backend conflict payloads; `docs/schedule_schema.md`

## Definition of done

- UI maps normalized conflict types (`soft_conflict`, `hard_conflict`) to visual states and tooltips.
- Inline conflict actions invoke backend-provided suggestion actions with deterministic outcomes.
- Publish preflight panel shows normalized warning/conflict summary and blocks unresolved hard conflicts.
- Common collision resolution flow is validated at `<=3 clicks/keystrokes`.
