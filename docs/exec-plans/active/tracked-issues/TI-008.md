# TI-008 — Task A2.2 — Add config-at-rest encryption for high-risk fields in JSON configs

- **Status:** Open
- **Owner role:** Security Engineer
- **Effort:** L
- **Dependencies:** High-risk field inventory; key management workflow from TI-004

## Definition of done

- High-risk JSON fields are classified and mapped to encryption requirements.
- Encryption/decryption workflow is documented with key-handling constraints.
- Validation procedure confirms encrypted-at-rest storage and safe rollback.
# TI-008 — v1.2 UI: inline conflict rendering and resolution actions

- **Status:** Closed
- **Owner role:** UI Engineer
- **Effort:** M
- **Dependencies:** TI-007; deterministic backend conflict payloads; `docs/schedule_schema.md`
- **Implementation artifact:** `docs/exec-plans/active/ti-008b-inline-conflicts.md`

## Definition of done

- UI maps normalized conflict types (`soft_conflict`, `hard_conflict`) to visual states and tooltips.
- Inline conflict actions invoke backend-provided suggestion actions with deterministic outcomes.
- Publish preflight panel shows normalized warning/conflict summary and blocks unresolved hard conflicts.
- Common collision resolution flow is validated at `<=3 clicks/keystrokes`.
