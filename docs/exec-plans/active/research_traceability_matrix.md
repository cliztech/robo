# Research Traceability Matrix

This matrix is a required planning artifact for implementation readiness.

Use one row per research claim and keep links to source artifacts specific and reviewable.

| Research claim | Source artifact | Decision impacted (PRD/Architecture/Epic) | Risk level | Validation owner | Implementation story ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Claim summary] | [Document path, section, or evidence link] | [PRD-### \| ARCH-### \| EPIC-###] | [High \| Medium \| Low] | [Role or owner] | [Story ID(s)] |
| [Claim summary] | [Document path, section, or evidence link] | [PRD-### \| ARCH-### \| EPIC-###] | [High \| Medium \| Low] | [Role or owner] | [Story ID(s)] |
| [Claim summary] | [Document path, section, or evidence link] | [PRD-### \| ARCH-### \| EPIC-###] | [High \| Medium \| Low] | [Role or owner] | [Story ID(s)] |

## Completion Criteria

- Every implementation story has at least one linked, validated research claim.
- High-risk claims have an explicit validation owner before story kickoff.
- PRD, Architecture, and Epic decisions are traceable to at least one source artifact.
