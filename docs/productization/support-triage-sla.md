# Support Triage Workflow and SLA Targets

## Severity Levels

- `S0` Blocker: service unusable or compliance-critical outage.
- `S1` Critical: major workflow broken with no acceptable workaround.
- `S2` Major: degraded workflow with workaround.
- `S3` Minor: low-impact defect or UX issue.

## SLA Targets

- `S0`: acknowledge in 15 minutes, mitigation in 1 hour, status updates every 30 minutes.
- `S1`: acknowledge in 1 hour, mitigation in 4 hours, status updates every 2 hours.
- `S2`: acknowledge in 4 hours, fix plan in 2 business days.
- `S3`: acknowledge in 1 business day, backlog scheduling in sprint planning.

## Triage Flow

1. Intake report and classify severity.
2. Assign owner team and incident commander.
3. Capture reproduction data and scope.
4. Apply immediate mitigation if available.
5. Confirm validation evidence before closure.

## Exit Requirements

- Root cause documented.
- Validation command outputs attached.
- Follow-up preventive action tracked with owner/date.
