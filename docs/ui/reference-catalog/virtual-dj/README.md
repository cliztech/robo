# Virtual DJ Visual Reference Catalog

This directory indexes all visual reference assets currently stored in the repository-level `images/` folder and used as inspiration inputs for DJ console planning.

## Reference Inputs

- Asset inventory: [`catalog.csv`](./catalog.csv)
- Source asset folder: [`images/`](../../../images/)
- Related plans:
  - [`docs/ui/dj_console_ui_research_plan.md`](../../dj_console_ui_research_plan.md)
  - [`docs/ui/radio_operator_ui_delivery_plan.md`](../../radio_operator_ui_delivery_plan.md)

## Allowed inspiration boundaries (aligned to research plan)

These references are approved for **conceptual inspiration** only:

- Layout patterns: dual-deck + center mixer shells, waveform rail placement, browser/table zoning.
- Functional interaction patterns: transport clusters, cue/hotcue behaviors, dense operator workflows, quick status scan architecture.
- Information density patterns: compact spacing, grouped controls, and module dock composition for fast decision-making.
- Color and signaling patterns: deck channel differentiation, warning/alert color hierarchy, and state emphasis for active/inactive controls.

## Forbidden copying boundaries

The following are explicitly disallowed:

- Brand/trademark reuse: any vendor names, logos, product marks, or identifiable branding treatment.
- Exact skin cloning: pixel-identical panel textures, gradients, spacing maps, or theme presets that recreate proprietary skins.
- Proprietary icon duplication: direct tracing/reuse of icon sets, glyphs, or branded symbols.
- Preset and naming reuse: copying proprietary layout names, product labels, or UI terminology where DGN-DJ naming exists.

All downstream implementation must remain original to **DGN-DJ by DGNradio** while preserving accessibility and broadcast-operational requirements.
