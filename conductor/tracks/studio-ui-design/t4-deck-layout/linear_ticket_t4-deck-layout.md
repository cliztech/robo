# Description

## Problem to solve
The primary workspace needs the high-density "rekordbox" feel for monitoring playout.

## Solution
Develop the high-fidelity deck components and mixer layout.

## Implementation Details
- Create `Deck` component (Waveform placeholder, Timers, Metadata).
- Create `Mixer` component (Faders, Level meters, EQ visuals).
- Implement layout toggle for 2-deck vs 4-deck modes.
- Use CSS Grid for high-density placement.
