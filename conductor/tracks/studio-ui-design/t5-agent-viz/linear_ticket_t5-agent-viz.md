# Description

## Problem to solve
Users need to see the AI agent's "thinking" process to build trust in automation.

## Solution
Create a real-time visualization layer for the agent's internal thought stream.

## Implementation Details
- `ThoughtStream` overlay component.
- Animated neon-green pulse/indicators for active reasoning.
- Feed display for "Reasoning -> Action" logs.
- WebSocket integration (stub) for real-time status updates.
