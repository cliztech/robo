# Active Context

## Current Focus
Executing "Phase 5: AI Integration" (Implement AI track analysis) now that the "Visionary Architect" context system is established.

## Recent Decisions
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to mandate the "Visionary Architect" context system (`.context/`) as the primary bootstrap for all agents.
- Adopted `.context/` directory as the single source of truth for high-level project context.
- Consolidated disparate documentation (`README.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `AGENTS.md`) into structured context files.

## Next Atomic Steps
- [x] Add deterministic BMAD routing for GUI/music console agent-team phrases (including "agwnt" typo handling).
- [ ] Verify `.context/` structure is complete.
- [ ] Resume "Phase 5: AI Integration" (Implement AI track analysis).
