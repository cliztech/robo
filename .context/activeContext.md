# Active Context

## Current Focus
Executing "Phase 5: AI Integration" (Implement AI track analysis) now that the "Visionary Architect" context system is established.

## Recent Decisions
- Published `docs/ui/dj_console_design_pod.md` as the mission-specific charter for GUI console design with explicit ownership cadence and quality gates.
- Linked design pod charter into `docs/ui/dj_console_gui_todo_backlog.md`, `docs/ui/radio_operator_ui_delivery_plan.md`, and `AGENTS.md` Design Team guidance.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to mandate the "Visionary Architect" context system (`.context/`) as the primary bootstrap for all agents.
- Adopted `.context/` directory as the single source of truth for high-level project context.
- Consolidated disparate documentation (`README.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `AGENTS.md`) into structured context files.

## Next Atomic Steps
- [ ] Run first weekly DJ console design review gate using the new pod charter checklist.
- [ ] Resume "Phase 5: AI Integration" (Implement AI track analysis).
