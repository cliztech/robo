# Active Context

## Current Focus
Migrating project context to "Visionary Architect" structure (`.context/`) to improve agent reliability and state management.

## Recent Decisions
- Adopted `.context/` directory as the single source of truth for high-level project context.
- Consolidated disparate documentation (`README.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `AGENTS.md`) into structured context files.
- Pause feature development (Phase 5) briefly to establish this context foundation.

## Next Atomic Steps
- [ ] Verify `.context/` structure is complete.
- [ ] Resume "Phase 5: AI Integration" (Implement AI track analysis).
- [ ] Update `AGENTS.md` to reference `.context/` (optional cleanup).
