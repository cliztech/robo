# Active Context

## Current Focus
Executing "Phase 5: AI Integration" (Implement AI track analysis) now that the "Visionary Architect" context system is established.

## Recent Decisions
- Resolved tracked-issue ID collisions between Track A security tasks and v1.2 scheduler UI tasks by separating scheduler work into TI-039/TI-040/TI-041.
- Added explicit one-to-one Track A/B/C/D coverage indexing in `docs/exec-plans/active/todo-p0-p1-tracked-issues.md`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to mandate the "Visionary Architect" context system (`.context/`) as the primary bootstrap for all agents.
- Adopted `.context/` directory as the single source of truth for high-level project context.
- Consolidated disparate documentation (`README.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `AGENTS.md`) into structured context files.

## Next Atomic Steps
- [ ] Keep tracked-issue coverage table in sync with status/ownership updates.
- [ ] Verify `.context/` structure is complete.
- [ ] Resume "Phase 5: AI Integration" (Implement AI track analysis).
