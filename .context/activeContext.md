# Active Context

## Current Focus
Executing "Phase 5: AI Integration" through a quick-dev next-phase plan that decomposes AI track analysis into sprintable stories (P5-01..P5-05).

## Recent Decisions
- Published `docs/exec-plans/active/2026-02-25-phase-5-ai-integration-next-phase.md` to operationalize Phase 5 into execution-ready slices with validation gates.
- Completed GUI prompt review and published agent-team execution plan at `docs/ui/gui_agent_team_review.md`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to mandate the "Visionary Architect" context system (`.context/`) as the primary bootstrap for all agents.
- Adopted `.context/` directory as the single source of truth for high-level project context.
- Consolidated disparate documentation (`README.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `AGENTS.md`) into structured context files.

## Next Atomic Steps
- [ ] Implement Story P5-01 (Typed Track Analysis Contract).
- [ ] Implement Story P5-02 (Deterministic Prompt Profile Resolver).
- [ ] Implement Story P5-03 (Resilient AI Invocation Layer).
- [ ] Implement Story P5-04 (Analysis Fingerprint Cache).
- [ ] Implement Story P5-05 (Verification Harness + latency baseline).
