# Active Context

## Current Focus
Executing "Phase 5: AI Integration" (Implement AI track analysis) now that the "Visionary Architect" context system is established.

## Recent Decisions

- Established `docs/architecture/canonical_runtime_map.md` as runtime ownership and framework-version source of truth; aligned `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.context/techStack.md`; added CI drift guard.
- Completed GUI prompt review and published agent-team execution plan at `docs/ui/gui_agent_team_review.md`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to mandate the "Visionary Architect" context system (`.context/`) as the primary bootstrap for all agents.
- Adopted `.context/` directory as the single source of truth for high-level project context.
- Consolidated disparate documentation (`README.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `AGENTS.md`) into structured context files.

## Next Atomic Steps
- [x] Publish canonical runtime map + CI drift guard for manifests/docs sync.
- [ ] Convert `docs/ui/gui_agent_team_review.md` into implementation stories mapped to GUI-001..GUI-030.
- [ ] Resume "Phase 5: AI Integration" (Implement AI track analysis).
- [x] Split mixed tracked-issue files and reassigned security tasks to dedicated TI IDs (TI-039/TI-040/TI-041) with reference updates.
