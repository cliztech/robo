# Active Context

## Current Focus
Building the next unfinished execution plans from the roadmap queue, starting with P1 Security items (TI-039/TI-040/TI-041).

## Recent Decisions
- Regenerated `docs/exec-plans/active/unfinished-task-build-plan.md` from the latest TODO/workflow state to refresh unfinished-task ordering.
- Published `docs/exec-plans/active/2026-02-25-next-unfinished-phase-build.md` to sequence the next phased work (TI-039 -> TI-040 -> TI-041).
- Completed GUI prompt review and published agent-team execution plan at `docs/ui/gui_agent_team_review.md`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to mandate the "Visionary Architect" context system (`.context/`) as the primary bootstrap for all agents.
- Adopted `.context/` directory as the single source of truth for high-level project context.
- Consolidated disparate documentation (`README.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `AGENTS.md`) into structured context files.

## Next Atomic Steps
- [ ] Execute TI-039 packet (approval workflows + immutable audit export contract).
- [ ] Execute TI-040 packet (config-at-rest encryption policy + operator workflow updates).
- [ ] Execute TI-041 packet (security smoke script + expected signatures).
- [x] Regenerate unfinished-task build plan and publish the next phased build artifact for P1 Security.
